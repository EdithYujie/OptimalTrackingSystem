# OptimalTrackingSystem


**Project Topic**
Optimal tracking system


**Project Objectives** 
-Determination of the estimation error variance for the measured azimuth angle from the Radar
-Determination of the optimal value  of A (tuning parameter of filter) for good approximation of the filter


**Project Result**
-The error estimation variance was obtained
-An ideal filter value was obtained for minimal error estimation variance
